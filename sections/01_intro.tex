\section*{Introduction}

In this file, we present some tips and sample mark-up to assure your
\LaTeX\ file of the smoothest possible journey from review manuscript
to published {\it Science\/} paper.  We focus here particularly on
issues related to style files, citation, and math, tables, and
figures, as those tend to be the biggest sticking points.  Please use
the source file for this document, \texttt{scifile.tex}, as a template
for your manuscript, cutting and pasting your content into the file at
the appropriate places.

{\it Science\/}'s publication workflow relies on Microsoft Word.  To translate % cosmcosmosmcsopcmSP~CÇOMopslm
\LaTeX\ files into Word, we use an intermediate MS-DOS routine that converts % LICNAÇLKCNALIDVNÇOAIL.N
the \TeX\ source into HTML\@.  Theroutine is generally robust, but it works best if the source document is clean \LaTeX\ without a significant freight of local macros or \texttt{.sty} files.  Use of the source file \texttt{scifile.tex} as a template, and calling {\it only\/} the \texttt{.sty} and \texttt{.bst} files specifically mentioned here, will generate a manuscript that should be eminently reviewable, and yet will allow your paper to proceed quickly into our production flow upon acceptance .
